# Pomodoer
### What is Pomodoer?

Pomodoer is a productivity app to help students studying together remotely manage their time and stay on task. Originally a project for UPenn WiCS's Femmehacks hackathon, I continued development on my own after the hackathon â€” adding a working timer, to do list, rooms functionality using WebSockets, and a makeshift database hosted on my Node.js server.

### What's next?

I'm hoping to add a MongoDB database and clean up the UI.

### Can a use this app?

Pomodoer is available at https://pomodoer.herokuapp.com/. Because Pomodoer is deployed through Heroku, the app will take some time to spin up!
